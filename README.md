To Do List<br>
<br>
GUI with TKinter Library <br>
Ensure all weather data that we want to pull is being handled in a useful way (example: I made the method to work with the wind speed so it 
  actually output something useful instead of a simple value in degrees) <br>
Error handling (ensure program loops around if we get a 404 error on our request... example: someone misspells the name of the city they want to find the weather for) -Brandon<br>
