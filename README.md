To Do List

GUI with TKinter Library
Ensure all weather data that we want to pull is being handled in a useful way (example: I made the method to work with the wind speed so it 
  actually output something useful instead of a simple value in degrees)
Error handling (ensure program loops around if we get a 404 error on our request... example: someone misspells the name of the city they want to find the weather for) -Brandon
